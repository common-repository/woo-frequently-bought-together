Woocommerce purchased together to purchase product with similar combo product to customer happy to purchase

== Description ==

**[Woocommerce Purchased Together](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-frequently-bought-together/)** plugin is the best choice to increase cross selling with **Woocommerce Combo Product**.

Your customers often do not need just one product, they need inspirations what other products could fit to the one they bought / will buy. 
**Example**: When I buy a smartphone, I may buy a charger or a case along with it. But how can I determine what fits best to my smartphone? Our [Woocommerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WooCommerce) plugin answers this question. You can manually assign frequently bought together (FBT) products OR, and that might be more interesting, our plugin automatically matches bought together products via Cart or Purchased algorithm
